# :computer: Awesome Portfolio Website


### Install
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/InasKamel/Portfolio-Template.git
```

### Notes

  - Regarding the shape in the navbar, I prefer to use a hexagon to perfectly match the design.

### Future Work
  - Hide h6 and p elements appearing when hovering on a hexagon image in small devices.
  - Fix blog section responsiveness (finished)
